# Couchbase

The Couchbase Autonomous Operator provides a native integration of Couchbase Server with open source Kubernetes. It enables you to automate the management of common Couchbase tasks such as the configuration, creation, scaling, and recovery of Couchbase clusters. By reducing the complexity of running a Couchbase cluster, it lets you focus on the desired configuration and not worry about the details of manual deployment and lifecycle management.
